Hi, This is a construction Management app. When you first go through the project link it will take you to the home page where you can see all projects added by the admin. If you are not a login then you can't see the admin and user page. Firstly you need to sign in the you can see all the details. Where Admin Can Add Projects and  admin have full access to delete and Edit the projects. There is Another Functionality that the admin can assign the specific project to contractor, supervisor and Project manager.
For example,  If you log in as a Supervisor then it will redirect to the project page where you can see all the projects that are assigned to the supervisor. On this page you can see all the details of the projects that are assigned to you and there is an option to complete the project 
if you click complete the project the project status will be completed and the same status will be updated on the admin side.
